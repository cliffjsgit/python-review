#Python Review

In these review exercises, you will be reviewing the basic Python techniques that are presented in the exercises of Think Python Chapters 1-8.

Start by cloning the Chapters 1-8 Exercises into you local repository.
     
     $ cd ~
     $ git clone https://github.com/cliffjsgit/python-review
     

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.
    
     $ cd ~/python-review
     ~/python-review (master)$ ls
     chapter1  chapter2  chapter3  chapter5  chapter6  chapter7  chapter8
    

Create a solutions directory in the review directory. 
      
      ~/python-review (master)$ mkdir solutions
      

Copy your all of your final/completed lab solutions from all chapters 
into the solutions directory.  For example, using chapter1:

     ~/python-review (master)$ cp chapter1/exercise*  solutions/
     ~/python-review (master)$ cd solutions/
     ~/python-review/solutions (master)$ ls exercise1.1.py  exercise1.2.py
     ~/python-review/solutions (master)$ cd ..
     ~/python-review (master)$ cp chapter2/exercise* solutions/
     ...
    
Start with chapter 1 and work forward to chapter 8.
Make sure you that you copy all of the exercise solutions from all chapters 
into the single solutions directory, preserving their orignal names

#Python Review

In these review exercises, you will be reviewing the basic Python techniques that are presented in the exercises of Think Python Chapters 1-8.

Start by cloning the Chapters 1-8 Exercises into you local repository.
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/cliffjsgit/python-review

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.
   $ cd ~/python-review
   ~/python-review (master)$ ls
   chapter1  chapter2  chapter3  chapter5  chapter6  chapter7  chapter8

Create a solutions directory in the review directory. 
   ~/python-review (master)$ mkdir solutions

Copy your all of your final/completed lab solutions from all chapters 
into the solutions directory.  For example, using chapter1:

   ~/python-review (master)$ cp chapter1/exercise*  solutions/
   ~/python-review (master)$ cd solutions/
   ~/python-review/solutions (master)$ ls exercise1.1.py  exercise1.2.py
   ~/python-review/solutions (master)$ cd ..
   ~/python-review (master)$ cp chapter2/exercise* solutions/

Start with chapter 1 and work forward to chapter 8..

Make sure you copy all exercise solutions into the solutions directory.

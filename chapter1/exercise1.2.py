# Below you will find excerpts from our book with the exercises for chapter 1.
# The book suggests that you should do these exercises in the python 
# interpreter. I would suggest that you actually do these in the file. If you
# need, you can do them in the interpreter. Ultimately this python file should
# look like the following:
#
# print("1. Use python to show the addition of 1+1.")
# answer = 1+1
# print("A: {}".format(answer))
#
# and the output should be so:
# 
# 1. Use python to show the addition of 1+1.
# A: 2
#
# NOTE: For questions that force you to invoke an error, please invoke the error
# in the interpreter and print the error. For questions that ask you to test if
# something errors and it does not cause an error; print answer as normal.

#
# Two words “interlock” if taking alternating letters from each forms a new 
# word. For example, “shoe” and “cold” interlock to form “schooled”.
#
# Question 1
# 1. Write a program that finds all pairs of words that interlock.
#    Hint: don’t enumerate all pairs!
#

#
# Question 2
# 2. Can you find any words that are three-way interlocked; that is, every third 
# letter forms a word, starting from the first, second or third?
#

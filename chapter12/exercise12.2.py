#
# Question 1
# 1. Write a program that reads a word list from a file (see Section 9.1) and 
# prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.
# 
# Here is an example of what the output might look like:
#
# ['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
# ['retainers', 'ternaries']
# ['generating', 'greatening']
# ['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']
#
# Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of 
# letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those letters. The 
# question is, how can you represent the collection of letters in a way that 
# can be used as a key?
#

#
# Question 2
# 2. Modify the previous program so that it prints the longest list of anagrams 
# first, followed by the second longest, and so on.
# 

#
# Question 3
# 3. In Scrabble a “bingo” is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along 
# with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter word. What collection of 8
# letters forms the most possible bingos? Hint: there are seven.

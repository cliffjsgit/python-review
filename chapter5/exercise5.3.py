print("\nExercise 5-3\n")
# If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in 
# a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other
# two are one inch long, you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet 
# in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is 
# possible to form a triangle:
#
#     If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then
#     you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, you can. (If the sum of two lengths
#     equals the third, they form what is called a "degenerate" triangle.)"
#
# Question 1
# 1. Write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, 
# and that prints either "Yes" or "No", depending on whether you can or cannot 
# form a triangle from sticks with the given lengths
#
def is_triangle(x,y,z):
      pass
#
# Question 2
# 2. Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, 
# converts them to integers, and uses is_triangle to check whether sticks with 
# the given lengths can form a triangle.

def ask_triangle():
      pass

print("\nExercise 5-2\n")
#
# Fermat's Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c
# such that 
#
# a^n + b^n = c^n
# 
# for any values of n greater than 2.
#
# Question 1
# 1. Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters a, b, c and 
# n-and checks to see if Fermat's theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 and a^n
# + b^n = c^n the program should print, "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!" 
# Otherwise the program should print, "No, that doesn't work."
#
def check_fermat(a,b,c,n):
      pass
#
# Question 2
# 2. Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n,
# converts them to integers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate
# Fermat's theorem.

def ask_fermat():

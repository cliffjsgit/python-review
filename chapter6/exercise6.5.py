# Question 1
# 1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that 
# divides both of them with no remainder. One way to find the GCD of two numbers
# is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b,
# then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we can use gcd (a, 0) = a.
#
# Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their 
# greatest common divisor.
#
def gcd(a, b):
    return False

print(gcd(160, 30))
print(gcd(45, 300))

#
# A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and forward, like 
# "noon" and "redivider". Recursively, a word is a palindrome if the first and 
# last letters are the same and the middle is a palindrome.
#
# The following are functions that take a string argument and return the first, 
# last, and middle letters:
#
# def first(word):
#     return word[0]
#      
# def last(word):
#     return word[-1]
#
# def middle(word):
#     return word[1:-1]
#
# We'll see how they work in Chapter 8.
#
# This allows you to use the functions from palindrome.py for the two questions
#
import palindrome
#
# Question 1
# 1. Type these functions into a file named palindrome.py and test them out. 
# What happens if you call middle with a string with two letters? One letter? 
# What about the empty string, which is written '' and contains no letters?
#

# 
# Question 2
# 2. Write a function called is_palindrome that takes a string argument and 
# returns True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise. Remember that you can 
# use the built-in function len to check the length of a string.
#
def is_palindrome(word):
    return False
